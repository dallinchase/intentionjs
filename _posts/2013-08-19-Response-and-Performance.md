Here's a very simple test that demonstrates how fast intention.js is. The page has three `div`s. The first is loaded with styles from the startâ€”loaded with the DOM. The other two are given a green background and `::before` content *only after* intention.js has registered them as intentional objects and has responded to its axes. 

{% highlight html %}
<div id="init">Class assigned without intent in source.</div>
<div intent in-base-class="base loaded"></div>
<div intent in-width: ></div>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
/* Will be green from the start */
div#init{
   background: seagreen;  
}

/* Class assigned to all tests when intention responds */
div.loaded{
   background: seagreen;
}

/* When the base context (the catch-all context that's always on) is passed */
div.base::before{
   content: "Base context passed. '.loaded' class assigned";
}

/* Browser width axis*/
div.mobile, div.tablet, div.standard{
   background: seagreen;
}
div.mobile::before, div.tablet::before, div.standard::before{
   content: "Width axis responded. '.loaded' class assigned.";
}
div.mobile::after{ content: "Mobile viewport"; }
div.tablet::after{ content: "Tablet viewport"; }
div.standard::after{ content: "Standard viewport"; }
{% endhighlight %}

At page load, the second and third `div`s do not yet have a class. When Intention responds, they are assigned a class `.loaded` that gives them a green background. They are also assigned content properties specific to the context that passed.

All of these assignments, of course, should seamless with the page load, demonstrating how quick your page can dynamically restructure.
